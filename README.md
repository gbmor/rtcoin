# rtcoin [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/tildecoin/rtcoin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/tildecoin/rtcoin) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/tildecoin/rtcoin/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/tildecoin/rtcoin)

`tildecoin` is a fun currency simulation concept originally written for the [tildeverse](https://tildeverse.org).
`rtcoin` is the second-generation implementation, meant to improve upon
the first. The specifications set forth in the
draft RFC for `tildecoin`, written by [~aewens](https://github.com/aewens), will be followed:
* [tildegit.org/aewens/rfcs/src/branch/master/draft-tilde-coin.md](https://tildegit.org/aewens/rfcs/src/branch/master/draft-tilde-coin.md)

This project is in early development.

If you're interested, I'm working on the development plan here: [PLAN.md](https://github.com/tildecoin/rtcoin/blob/master/PLAN.md). I'll update this when it's finished.

`rtcoin` uses a client-server architecture, per the RFC.

Initial work is being done on [`rtcoin-server`](https://github.com/tildecoin/rtcoin/tree/master/rtcoin-server),
which will handle connections to clients, client authentication, and manage the ledger as a 
table in a `SQLite v3` database. Afterwards, work will move to `rtcoin-client`, which will 
be what users interact with to display their balances, transfer `tildecoin` to other users, etc.

## Updates

**2019.07.27**

I've decided on prompting for the database password on `rtcoin-server` startup. This was a compromise that took into account implementation complexity, security, and user experience with respect to controlling the server.
