# rtcoin [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/tildecoin/rtcoin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/tildecoin/rtcoin) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/tildecoin/rtcoin/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/tildecoin/rtcoin)

`tildecoin` is a fun currency simulation concept originally written for the [tildeverse](https://tildeverse.org).
`rtcoin` is the second-generation implementation, meant to extend and improve upon
the first. In addition, the specifications set forth in the
draft RFC for `tildecoin`, written by [~aewens](https://github.com/aewens), will be followed.
* [tildegit.org/aewens/rfcs/src/branch/master/draft-tilde-coin.md](https://tildegit.org/aewens/rfcs/src/branch/master/draft-tilde-coin.md)

`rtcoin` will use a client-server architecture.

This project is in early development.
