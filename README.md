`tcoin` implementation in Rust.
[`login000/tcoin`](https://github.com/login000/tcoin)
is a fun currency simulation originally written for [tilde.town](https://tilde.town).

This is a work in progress. Follow/contribute using the [trello board](https://trello.com/b/WaOrNJHq/rtcoin).

Using Rust `nightly >= 1.38`, however, travis builds include `stable` and `beta`.
